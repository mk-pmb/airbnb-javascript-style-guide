Needs major rewrite
===================

I'm cloning the AJSG to help fix some of the missing explanation,
but there's much more to fix before it's gonna be something I can
endorse.

* Yes, sticking to the rules may reduce damage in a scenario
  where you have to work with coders whose code would be an
  utter mess without close guidance. Ending up in this situation
  may seem, or even be, unavoidable in lots of startup companies.

* If you're not in that situation already, there's still hope you
  can avoid it:

* If you can afford the luxury of trying to learn to write better
  code without having to simultaneously fight off imminent threats,
  I suggest another approach: Go for a guide that
  * focuses on what pitfalls exist in the language and what risks are
    implied in which coding habit,
  * and then suggests strategies to avoid those traps and damage.
    There may be multiple ways to avoid them.
  * The ["Crockford on JavaScript"][cojs] lectures are a good example
    of this teaching method. (The first lecture is about learning from
    history, so some people prefer to skip that.)
  * CoJS is about ES5, but the more general ideas apply to any
    programming language, including modern ECMAScript versions.

* If some aspect carries risks, it's good to know all its risks.
  It may happen that some of them don't apply to your project,
  or taking one of the risks seems justified by other factors.
  In that case you'd probably like to know whether it means you
  don't need to care, or whether you've overlooked another
  important aspect.

* For all kinds of planning in life, making a smart choice requires
  knowing what you're trying to achieve.
  Only then can you gauge which choice of action looks most promising.
  Thus, your coding style should be derived from objectives.
  Any guide that lacks in consideration of its motives is prone to
  cargo cult: That is, doing things that have turned out to be beneficial
  for the authors in their past, but may be an unnecessary burden in other
  circumstances or may have become outdated advice.
